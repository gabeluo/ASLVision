# NewHacks2020
Hackthon project for NewHacks 2020
##Description
We wanted to make a simple, clean, and helpful project. Even in today's technology driven world, there is still a significant communication barrier when interacting with an individual who utilizes American Sign Language. This is our take on a potential solution to that communication barrier.
